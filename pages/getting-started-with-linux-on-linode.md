* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) I use to run Windows on my Ubuntu/Linux so I can demo how to connect to a remote Linux box from Windows. You could use it to install Linux locally on top of your Windows machine.

## Terminal emulator / local shell

* Install [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/) and use Git Bash
* or install [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)


## Linode

* Register on [Linode](https://linode.com)
* Admin interface of [Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes)
